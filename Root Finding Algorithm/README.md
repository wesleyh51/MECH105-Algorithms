# Root Finding Algorithm
This algorithm solves for the angle of the force to the horivontal surface necessary to over come static friction and move the box. It does this orginizing the pre defined variable into an equation and then feeding that function into a pre defined functio for bisection to then solve for the angle and print the resuls.
