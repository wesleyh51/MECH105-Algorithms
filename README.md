# MECH105-Algorithms
This repository contains the code for the projects I have completed for my MECH105 class in 2021
This contains:
* **Degradation of Aqueous Bromide:** Plots the degradtion of bromide in water over time.
* **False Position Algorithm:** Determins the root of a funtion by utilizing bisection method.
* **LU Factorization (With Partial Pivoting):** This is a funtion to perform LU pactorization on a ceofficent matrix.
* **Root Finding Algorithm:** This algorithm finds the angle of force needed to overcome the static friction of a pre-defined box
* **Simple Electric Circuit:** Based off an equation for q(t) this algorithm creates two graphs.
* **Simpson1/3 Algorithm:** This algorithm takes two arrays which corrilate to the x and y values of a funtion, then inputs them into the composite simpson 1/3 function to calculate the aproximate integral
* **Special Matrix Function Algorithm:** This takes in criteria of n and m to comput an nxm matrix that meets the criteria specified in the folder.
* **volume of Tank Algorithm:** This algorithm calculates the volme of a cylinder tank with a cone on top for a given value of h (height)
Input is h and output is volume.
