# Simpson1/3 Algorithm
This algorithm uses the simpson 1/3 rule to get an approximate integral. The inputs are:
* x = a array containing the x values of a function
* y = a array containg all the y values of a function (for the given values of x)
**Warning:** The x array must be equally spaced and the x and y arrays must be equally spaced.

The algorithm then puts the value into the composite simpson1/3 function and then has an output of

I = the approximate integral.
