# **LU Factorization** (*With Partial Pivoting*)
This algorithm takes in the inputs of a matrix (A) of the coefficents of a polanomial.

The algorithm then performs LU factorization with pivoting and has an out put of:
* L = lower triangular matrix, with 1's along the diagonals
* U = upper triangular matrix
* P = the pivot matrix
