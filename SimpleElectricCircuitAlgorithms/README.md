# Simple Electric Circuit 
This alogorythm creates two graphs that plots the the charge of the copacitore vs. time and then again but changing the Capacitore to be 10x greater.
The graphs are bases on the equition q(t) = q_0e^(-Rt/2L)cos(sqrt((1/LC)-(R/(2L))^(2)t) where
* q(t) = charge of the copacitore
* q_0 = initial charge
* R =  the resistance
* L = inductance
* t = time
* C = capacitance
