# Special Matrix Function Algorithm
This algorythm is a function that takes in n and m 
* n = rows
* m = collums

It then uses those values to return an nxm matrix in which:
* The value of each element in the first row is the number of the column.
* The value of each element in the first column is the number of the row.
* and the rest of the elements each has a value equal to the sum of the element above it and element to the left.

If the user does not input two arguments then the function will through an error
